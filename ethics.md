## Ethical Concerns in Technology

At a global level, the rapid development of technology has raised a host of ethical issues that need to be addressed. As we incorporate new systems, devices and technological advances into our daily lives, it becomes increasingly important to address these issues. On this page, we look at two broad ethical issues that are commonly discussed in the technology world.

### Privacy and Surveillance

Privacy and surveillance are of the utmost importance in the world of information technology. Integration of features like biometrics and delivery robots, as well as AI, introduces convenience and support for the human user. However, these advances also present risks that need to be carefully considered.

According to Wicker and Ghosh, 2020, data breaches may result in the disclosure of sensitive user information stored in biometric databases, including facial patterns and fingerprints. This highlights the need for strong security measures to protect user privacy.

Glenn Greenwald's TED Talk on why privacy matters emphasizes the importance of protecting privacy in an era of pervasive surveillance. It calls for a critical examination of the impact of surveillance on individual rights and freedoms in an IT society.

### Misinformation and Digital Vigilantes

Misinformation, disinformation, and fake news have become prevalent challenges in the digital age. Starbird et al. (2014) delve into the occurrence of rumors and false information on Twitter after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The study highlights the role of digital platforms in the spread of misinformation and the challenges it poses.

In addressing these ethical concerns, it becomes crucial for the technology community to devise solutions that prioritize safety, privacy, and the responsible use of digital platforms. It is our collective responsibility to mitigate the potential risks associated with technological advancements and ensure a secure and ethical IT society.

## እንኳን ደህና መጣህ || Welcome
This is how you say welcome from google translate in my native tongue Amharic. It looks like it has more words because it technically means "thankfull that you came in peace". Notice how much
detail was unregistered by google translate. That is also similar to how much detail is left out from Information Technology Ethics if you do not understand the nuances in the way data and privacy
play a role in technology. 

The ethics page goes into more in depth of the ethical concerns in technology. The citations
page will show the list of sources that contribute in the understanding of this and the footer shows additional information about the making
of this webpage.
